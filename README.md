# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-RNN
A solution to the problem of sentiment analysis from text using deep learning. The problem was analysed using a variation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) - the Long short-term memory (LSTM). 

The task was to analyse and prepare a selected dataset and create a classification model. As a result of the experiments, a model was found which best classifies whether a tweet has negative overtones.
